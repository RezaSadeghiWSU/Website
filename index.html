				The aim of this study is to detect changes in behavior (agitation, depression, and apathy) and
				activity patterns of patients with dementia by using a combination of wearable and environmental sensors
				using a mobile platform. Detecting these behavior changes will result in a deeper understanding of the causes
				of mood and behavioral changes. This will involve detecting fluctuations in sleep patterns and evaluating
				the effects on stress using standard clinical methods. This can help predict mood events, which in turn
				can help alert clinicians for early intervention. For more information, please refer to

				<b>Web Robot Detection</b>
				<br><br/>
				<img class="spic" alt="Reza's Picture" src="./pic/2017 A soft computing approach for benign and malicious web robot detection.png">
				The accurate detection of web robot sessions from a web server log is essential to take accurate traffic-
				level measurements and to protect the performance and privacy of information on a Web server. Moreover,
				the irrecoverable risks of visits from malicious robots that intentionally try to evade web server
				intrusion detection systems, covering-up their visits with fabricated fields in their http request packets,
				cannot be ignored. To separate both types of robots from humans in practice, analysts turn to heuristic
				methods or state-of-the-art soft computing approaches that have only been tuned to the specification of
				a kind of web server. Noting that the landscape of web robot agents is ever changing, and that behavioral
				patterns and characteristics vary across different web servers, both options are lacking. To overcome this
				challenge, my colleagues and I proposed several methods based on Fuzzy Rough Set, Markov Clustering, Self-organizing Map concepts.

				Event handlers have wide range of applications
				such as medical assistant systems and fire suppression systems.
				These systems try to provide accurate responses based
				on the least information. Support vector data description
				(SVDD) is one of the appropriate tools for such detections,
				which should handle lack of information. Therefore, many
				efforts have been done to improve SVDD. Unfortunately,
				the existing descriptors suffer from weak data characteristic
				in sparse data sets and their tuning parameters are organized
				improperly. These issues cause reduction of accuracy in event
				handlers when they are faced with data shortage. Therefore,
				my colleagues and I proposed several methods based on Fuzzy Rough Set, Bat Algorithm, and Chaos theory.

				Determination of facilities, such as factories or
				warehouses, location and availability conditions is one of the
				important and strategic decisions for an organization to make.
				Transportation costs that form a major part of goods price are
				dependent to this decision making. There are verity of methods
				have been presented to achieve the optimal locations of these
				facilities which are generally deterministic. In real world accurate
				estimation of the effective parameters on this optimal location for
				single or multiple time periods is difficult and merely impossible.In
				this research, my colleagues and I tried to achieve an efficient model with
				consideration of uncertainty demand over different time periods on
				the basis of previously presented models that we call stochastic
				dynamic facilities location problem. In order to do so we use
				stochastic constrain programming which convert the stochastic
				model to a deterministic one. The results of this research is presented in <a href="http://journals.iau.ir/article_532425_1123cd8d907c846311110e2dfbc5bf60.pdf">“Dynamic Facility Location with Stochastic Demand”</a> and

				Nowadays the requests of managers and other
				persons who benefited by such projects for drop total
				project’s cost have increased considerably. Besides,
				the amount of changes exert on this factors can result
				to variation in initial estimation of them. In this way,
				however; by observing this types of changes in
				different circumstances, the ideal quality for projects
				is going to be considered. Moreover, generally in
				realty world, either falling in time consuming or the
				amount usage of resources for a task could not lead
				to decline of task quality. As a result, assigning fixed
				and deterministic values for assessing ideal quality
				leading to unpredictable outcomes. I this study,
				fuzzy logic developed remarkably to measure the
				quality for wide range of tasks and activities in
				various variation circumstances. At last, the
				presented model apply to real case study and the
				obtained values have proved the efficiency of
				proposed model in comparison to others in
				deterministic situations. The report of this research is reflected in
				<a href="Documents\Reports\Solving the equilibrium problem of time, cost, resource and quality of project network by using expanded fuzzy logic set_paper.pdf">“Solving the equilibrium problem of time, cost, resource and quality of project network by using expanded fuzzy logic set”</a>.
