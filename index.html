				<img class="spic" alt="" src="./pic/ICU_Monitoring.jpg">
				Modern patient monitoring systems use Electronic Health Records to 
				extract and classify physiological vital signals with the aim of assisting
				clinicians in Intensive Care Units. Varied methods have been proposed
				to improve patient monitoring systems. The clinical usefulness of such
				systems is mainly dependent on how sensitive and specific these methods
				are to clinical outliers. In order to enhance the probability of having
				a robust and clinically valid method, different signals have been fed to
				such systems. The common signals for monitoring systems are body temperature,
				heart rate, respiration rate, blood pressure, pulse oxygenation, and blood glucose.
				As these signals have distinguished characteristics, therefore, they should be handled
				differently. This research endeavors to provide an accurate and easy-to-process method
				for monitoring patients based on their vital signals.

				The aim of this study is to detect changes in behavior (agitation, depression, and apathy) and
				activity patterns of patients with dementia and their caregivers by using a combination of wearable and environmental sensors
				using a mobile platform. Detecting these behavior changes will result in a deeper understanding of the causes
				of mood and behavioral changes. This will involve detecting fluctuations in sleep patterns and evaluating
				the effects on stress using standard clinical methods. This can help predict mood events, which in turn
				can help alert clinicians for early intervention. For more information, please refer to

				By the definition of the World Health Organization, alcohol use disorder refers to any form of alcohol consumption that causes
				health problems. Alcohol Withdrawal Syndrome (AWS) occurs roughly 4 to 72 hours following cessation or reduction of prolonged,
				heavy alcohol ingestion. Withdrawal delirium or Delirium Tremens is considered the most dangerous symptom of AWS which can lead to
				the death. During the initial 8 hours after the last drink, patients face with anxiety, insomnia, nausea, and abdominal pain.
				This condition is followed by high blood pressure, increased body temperature, unusual heart rate, and confusion.
				If this syndrome does not receive any treatment, the patients will suffer from hallucinations, fever, seizures, and agitation.
				As a result, there is an essential need to predict and treat this syndrome in the initial stages.

				World Wide Web (WWW) is the biggest source of available information.
				Web mining tries to extract desired data from this massive information in an efficient way.
				The information is retrieved from three distinguished levels of content, structure, and usage

				convert huge source of texts, images, sounds, and videos into usable information.
				However, each source of information implies different concepts in distinct context.
				As a result, separating the accessible documents into distinguished categories,
				known as web structure mining, is essential. The speed of producing new information
				is too fast such that expert knowledge is not enough to categorize the huge amount of WWW information.
				One of the best methods to address this issue is to consider the navigational behavior of users
				known as web usage mining. I am following these three web mining levels

				<b>Mortality Prediction</b>

				<img class="spic" alt="Reza's Picture" src="./pic/ICU_Monitoring.jpg"><!--img"./pic/Signals.png.png"-->
				Early hospital mortality prediction is critical as intensivists strive to make efficient medical decisions
				about the severely ill patients staying in intensive care units. As a result, various methods have been developed
				to address this problem based on clinical records. However, some of the laboratory test results are time-consuming
				and need to be processed. To address this issue, we proposed a novel method to predict mortality using features extracted from
				the heart signals of patients within the first hour of ICU admission. In order to predict the risk, quantitative features
				have been computed based on the heart rate signals of ICU patients. Outcomes of the experiments indicates that heart rate signals
				can be used for predicting mortality in patients in the ICU, achieving a comparable performance with existing predictions that rely
				on high dimensional features from clinical records which need to be processed and may contain missing information.
				The outcomes of this research is reported in <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352648318300357?via%3Dihub#!">“Early Hospital Mortality Prediction using Vital Signals”</a> (<a href="https://www.slideshare.net/RezaSadeghi4/chase-presentation-117071754">Presentation slides</a> / <a href="https://github.com/RezaSadeghiWSU/Early-Hospital-Mortality-Prediction-using-Vital-Signals">Source code</a>)

				Tor is among most well-known dark net in the world. It has noble uses, including as a platform for free speech and information
				dissemination under the guise of true anonymity, but may be culturally better known as a conduit for
				criminal activity and as a platform to market illicit goods and data.
				Past studies on the content of Tor support this notion, but were carried out by targeting popular domains
				likely to contain illicit content. A survey of past studies may thus not yield a complete evaluation of the content
				and use of Tor. This work addresses this gap by presenting a broad evaluation of the content of the English Tor ecosystem.

				The accurate detection of web robot sessions from a web server log is essential to take accurate traffic-
				level measurements and to protect the performance and privacy of information on a Web server. Moreover,
				the irrecoverable risks of visits from malicious robots that intentionally try to evade web server
				intrusion detection systems, covering-up their visits with fabricated fields in their http r
				est packets,
				cannot be ignored. To separate both types of robots from humans in practice, analysts turn to heuristic
				methods or state-of-the-art soft computing approaches that have only been tuned to the specification of
				a kind of web server. Noting that the landscape of web robot agents is ever changing, and that behavioral
				patterns and characteristics vary across different web servers, both options are lacking. To overcome this
				challenge, my colleagues and I proposed several methods based on Fuzzy Rough Set, Markov Clustering, Self-organizing Map concepts.

				Event handlers have wide range of applications

				These systems try to provide accurate responses based
				on the least information. Support vector data description
				(SVDD) is one of the appropriate tools for such detections,
				which should handle lack of information. Therefore, many
				efforts have been done to improve SVDD. Unfortunately,
				the existing descriptors suffer from weak data characteristic
