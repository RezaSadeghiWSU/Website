				<img class="spic" alt="" src="./pic/ICU_Monitoring.jpg">
				Modern patient monitoring systems use Electronic Health Records to 
				extract and classify physiological vital signals with the aim of assisting
				clinicians in Intensive Care Units. Varied methods have been proposed
				to improve patient monitoring systems. The clinical usefulness of such
				systems is mainly dependent on how sensitive and specific these methods
				are to clinical outliers. In order to enhance the probability of having
				a robust and clinically valid method, different signals have been fed to
				such systems. The common signals for monitoring systems are body temperature,
				heart rate, respiration rate, blood pressure, pulse oxygenation, and blood glucose.
				As these signals have distinguished characteristics, therefore, they should be handled
				differently. This research endeavors to provide an accurate and easy-to-process method
				for monitoring patients based on their vital signals.

				The aim of this study is to detect changes in behavior (agitation, depression, and apathy) and

				convert huge source of texts, images, sounds, and videos into usable information.
				However, each source of information implies different concepts in distinct context.
				As a result, separating the accessible documents into distinguished categories,

				<img class="spic" alt="Reza's Picture" src="./pic/SQ_HRV.png">
				We employed machine learning techniques to enhance sleep quality prediction by selecting more effective features 
				and reducing the dependability to the expert knowledge in feature computation. 
				We designed several sleep quality methodologies by applying a great range of machine learning techniques over
				electronic health records, heart rate variability (HRV) features, and the raw Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. 
				In the process of predicting sleep quality from HRV, 
				we came up with a clinical decision support system that processes the raw electrocardiogram signals
				independently from the prior knowledge of sleep experts. 
				This system employs a convolutional neural network (CNN) to predict sleep quality
				based on heart activities during each night by analyzing images of two ECG signals during Polysomnography studies. 
				To our knowledge, this is one of the first studies to predict sleep quality using HRV.

				Abnormal sleep quality or sleep quantity causes excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS),
				which is a highly prevalent condition in the older adult society. 
				EDS is a symptom of several diseases, such as neurological disorders, e.g. dementia, and sleep breathing disorders,
				e.g. apnea. Distinguishing disease-specific risk factors of EDS can both reveal underlying reasons of abnormal sleep quality
				and enhance its prediction. To do so, we investigated EDS risk factors in two groups of patients one group with 
				and one group without severe sleep apnea. The report of this research has been reflected in <a href="https://www.abstractsonline.com/pp8/#!/8998/presentation/10490">“Sleep Propensity and Sleep Apnea-Specific Hypoxia Are Associated with Excessive Daytime Sleepiness”</a>

				<img class="spic" alt="Reza's Picture" src="./pic/2019 Sleep quality prediction in caregivers using physiological signals.png">
				Most caregivers of people with dementia (CPWD) experience a high degree of stress due to the demands of providing care,
				especially when addressing unpredictable behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia.
				Such challenging responsibilities make caregivers susceptible to poor sleep quality with detrimental effects on their overall health.
				Hence, monitoring caregivers’ sleep quality can provide important CPWD stress assessment.
				Most current sleep studies are based on polysomnography, which is expensive and potentially disrupts the caregiving routine.
				To address these issues, we propose a clinical decision support system to predict sleep quality based on
				trends of physiological signals in the deep sleep stage. This research has been elaborated on <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S001048251930160X">“Sleep quality prediction in caregivers using physiological signals”</a> (<a href="https://www.slideshare.net/RezaSadeghi4/sleep-quality-prediction-in-caregivers-using-physiological-signals-146925927">Presentation slides</a> / <a href="https://github.com/RezaSadeghiWSU/Sleep-quality-in-caregivers">Source code</a>)

				Early hospital mortality prediction is critical as intensivists strive to make efficient medical decisions
				about the severely ill patients staying in intensive care units. As a result, various methods have been developed
				to address this problem based on clinical records. However, some of the laboratory test results are time-consuming
				and need to be processed. To address this issue, we proposed a novel method to predict mortality using features extracted from
				the heart signals of patients within the first hour of ICU admission. In order to predict the risk, quantitative features
				have been computed based on the heart rate signals of ICU patients. Outcomes of the experiments indicates that heart rate signals
				can be used for predicting mortality in patients in the ICU, achieving a comparable performance with existing predictions that rely
				on high dimensional features from clinical records which need to be processed and may contain missing information.
				The outcomes of this research are reported in <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352648318300357?via%3Dihub#!">“Early Hospital Mortality Prediction using Vital Signals”</a> (<a href="https://www.slideshare.net/RezaSadeghi4/chase-presentation-117071754">Presentation slides</a> / <a href="https://github.com/RezaSadeghiWSU/Early-Hospital-Mortality-Prediction-using-Vital-Signals">Source code</a>)

				Tor is among most well-known dark net in the world. It has noble uses, including as a platform for free speech and information
				dissemination under the guise of true anonymity, but may be culturally better known as a conduit for
				criminal activity and as a platform to market illicit goods and data.
				Past studies on the content of Tor support this notion, but were carried out by targeting popular domains
				likely to contain illicit content. A survey of past studies may thus not yield a complete evaluation of the content
				and use of Tor. This work addresses this gap by presenting a broad evaluation of the content of the English Tor ecosystem.

				The accurate detection of web robot sessions from a web server log is essential to take accurate traffic-
				level measurements and to protect the performance and privacy of information on a Web server. Moreover,
				the irrecoverable risks of visits from malicious robots that intentionally try to evade web server
				intrusion detection systems, covering-up their visits with fabricated fields in their http r
				est packets,
				cannot be ignored. To separate both types of robots from humans in practice, analysts turn to heuristic
				methods or state-of-the-art soft computing approaches that have only been tuned to the specification of
				a kind of web server. Noting that the landscape of web robot agents is ever changing, and that behavioral
				patterns and characteristics vary across different web servers, both options are lacking. To overcome this
				challenge, my colleagues and I proposed several methods based on Fuzzy Rough Set, Markov Clustering, Self-organizing Map concepts.

				Event handlers have wide range of applications
				such as medical assistant systems and fire suppression systems.
				These systems try to provide accurate responses based
				on the least information. Support vector data description
				(SVDD) is one of the appropriate tools for such detections,
				which should handle lack of information. Therefore, many
				efforts have been done to improve SVDD. Unfortunately,
				the existing descriptors suffer from weak data characteristic
				in sparse data sets and their tuning parameters are organized
				improperly. These issues cause reduction of accuracy in event
				handlers when they are faced with data shortage. Therefore,
				my colleagues and I proposed several methods based on Fuzzy Rough Set, Bat Algorithm, and Chaos theory.

				Determination of facilities, such as factories or
				warehouses, location and availability conditions is one of the
				important and strategic decisions for an organization to make.
				Transportation costs that form a major part of goods price are
				dependent to this decision making. There are verity of methods
				have been presented to achieve the optimal locations of these
				facilities which are generally deterministic. In real world accurate
				estimation of the effective parameters on this optimal location for
				single or multiple time periods is difficult and merely impossible.In
				this research, my colleagues and I tried to achieve an efficient model with
				consideration of uncertainty demand over different time periods on
				the basis of previously presented models that we call stochastic
				dynamic facilities location problem. In order to do so we use
				stochastic constrain programming which convert the stochastic
				model to a deterministic one. The results of this research is presented in <a href="http://journals.iau.ir/article_532425_1123cd8d907c846311110e2dfbc5bf60.pdf">“Dynamic Facility Location with Stochastic Demand”</a> and

				Nowadays the requests of managers and other
				persons who benefited by such projects for drop total
				project’s cost have increased considerably. Besides,
				the amount of changes exert on this factors can result
				to variation in initial estimation of them. In this way,
				however; by observing this types of changes in
				different circumstances, the ideal quality for projects
				is going to be considered. Moreover, generally in
				realty world, either falling in time consuming or the
				amount usage of resources for a task could not lead
				to decline of task quality. As a result, assigning fixed
				and deterministic values for assessing ideal quality
				leading to unpredictable outcomes. I this study,
